# barMate

barMate is an Electron app for Windows and Linux that allows you to create and manage a recipe book of cocktails.

With barMate you can also see the ABV of any cocktail you build in real time, based on the brands you use.

## Installation

Download the binaries for your target operating system from the releases section ([Linux](https://github.com/zworcester/barMate/releases/tag/Linux), [Windows](https://github.com/zworcester/barMate/releases/tag/Windows)). Simply double-click the executable file to run!

## Using barMate

Barmate will open to a home page with two different links. One will take you to the Cocktail Builder, which also functions as a cocktail viewer. The other will take you to your recipe book.

You can create new cocktails in the cocktail builder, and in the recipe book all of your cocktails are laid out for you in a nice grid.

## Debugging

You can launch the app in developer mode by passing the command line arguments "--dev" or "-d" to the executable. This mode opens up the developer console when you launch the app. You can also open up the console whenever you'd like using View>Show Developer Tools.
